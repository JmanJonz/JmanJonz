Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ammon, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in software development in particular full stack web development. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

- I'm currently learning software development
- I'm looking to find work but not just any kind of work. I want to spend my time and use my skills to work on something I find adds value to peoples lives in a meaningful way as well as somethign that I find really interesting. 

## Technologies and Tools

- Proficient in: Many different languages and technologies, but I am best at full stack web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS...). 
- Skills: I am really good at taking a project and breaking it down into smaller problems that I then am able to learn about and solve. I also am good at working on teams and communicating clearly to get results.
