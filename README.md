# Ammon Jones

Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I am an entry level full stack engineer specializing in the MERN stack. 

## About Me

- I graduated with a BS degree in software development with a 3.9 GPA
- I have done two internships in full stack development both using react on the frontend, one using express, and the other c# .net on the backend.
- I'm looking to find work but not just any kind of work. I want to spend my time and use my skills to work on something I find adds value to peoples lives in a meaningful way as well as somethign that I find    really interesting. I am open to all kinds of work full time, part time, contract, freelance. 

## Technologies and Tools

- Proficient in: Many different languages and technologies, but I am best at full stack web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS...). 
- Skills: I am really good at taking a project and breaking it down into smaller problems that I then am able to learn about and solve. I also am good at working on teams and communicating clearly to get results.
